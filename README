(Work in progress)

Everything is rendered server-side and sent back to the client as a single html file per page.
No javascript, no extra requests once the page is received.
The goal of this code is to experiment the performance of good old server-side rendering
compared to today's web applications that typically use asynchronous http requests to remote APIs.

Runs on Rack + Puma + SQLite
